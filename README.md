# Project_2_Coin_Change

Program uses Python 3.x interpreter and is packaged into a module.

To run outside of the directory, use command "python3 Project_2_Coin_Change 'relative/link/to/file.txt'".

To run inside directory, use command "__main__.py 'relative/link/to/file.txt'" or "python3 __main__.py 'relative/link/to/file.txt'".

Running the module in this way reads the input file and runs each set of coins and change amount
through the greedy and dynamic programming algorithms. Since the changeslow algorithm is much slower
than the other two and requires very different inputs in order to run in a timely fashion, the
changeslow files are found in a subdirectory "Project_2_Coin_Change/changeslow_files"
